The event_data.csv dataset contains the following columns:

event: Text description of the event.

timestamp: Unix timestamp (which I will convert to a human-readable date).

type: The sentiment of the event (positive or negative).

stablecoin: The stablecoin associated with the event (e.g., 'usdc', 'ustc', 'dai').
